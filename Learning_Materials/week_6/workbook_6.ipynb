    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will introduce the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm for supervised learning.\n",
    "    - We will use the Iris dataset we introduced in the previous week.\n",
    "    - You are provided code for 1NN (1 nearest neighbour) and will extend this, using generative AI, to KNN (k nearest neighbours).\n",
    "    - We will also introduce several common Sklearn functions for splitting data into training and test sets, and visualising the results of classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook will introduce Decision Trees, another supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "    - We will use the Sklearn implementation and explore how to limit tree growth (number/depth of branches) to prevent overfitting."

    "## Implementing K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations of supervised ML algorithms typically have two functions `fit()` and `predict()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**'Fitting'** -  means building/training the model with the training data, so that it (hopefully) makes good predictions.\n",
    "   - For  most ML algorithms **`fitting' is a search process**:\n",
    "      - search space <=> combinations of values for parameters that define a model's behaviour.\n",
    "      - quality measure <=> accuracy of predictions for training set (and maybe complexity)\n",
    "  - **For KNN**  fitting just means storing the training data\n",
    "     - there are sophisticated methods which *search* for the best subset of data to use, but we won't worry about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting** - means using the model to make predictions e.g. the class of a particular data example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For KNN predicting the label of a new example from the test set:\n",
    "1. Measure distance to example point from every member of the training set.\n",
    "2. Find the K Nearest Neighbours.  \n",
    "   - In other words, the K members of the training set with the smallest distances (*calculated in step 1*)\n",
    "3. Count the labels of those K training items and return the most common one as the predicted label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a figure illustrating the start and first two steps of process.  \n",

This does not mean it is correct, and sometimes it will <i>'hallucinate'</i>, i.e. make stuff up!<br>\n",
    "    So you should always <i>verify</i> anything you ask GenAI to create. For code this should come from your understanding of the code it has generated and the algorithm. But for a more concrete test we can also write some test cases to check the output is correct.<br><br>\n",
    "    Your <code>SimpleKNNClassifier()</code> with <code>K=1</code> should reach the same accuracy as the previous <code>Simple1NNClassifier()</code> did. <br>But we should check it works for other values of K and also on other data.<br><br>\n",
