    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 9 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. The aim of this session is to give you practical experience of creating a  knowledge base for an expert system with some simple forward chaining.\n",
    "2. To do that you will author a simple chat-bot using the AIML knowledge representation language. \n",
    "3. To aid your learning, your chat-bot should hold your revision notes about the core concepts from the lectures so far, in the form of a 'FAQ'\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "- Made your first set of twelve revision questions and answers.\n",
    "- Coded up your chatbot to answer those questions.\n",
    "- Successfully used  &lt;srai&gt; tag-pairs in AIML to do some simple forward chaining for different greetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your chatbot using &lt;srai&gt; tag-pairs storing knowledge about language,   \n",
    "  so that your bot can respond to different ways of asking the same question\n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your bots with categories for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "- Pandorabots (www.pandorabots.com) offers free sign-in and hosts a web-based interface for authoring bots.   \n",
    "   Once you start doing more complex things, the feedback on what is happening as your queries are processed  is a little better than the python aiml version.  \n",
    "   But some students have found the text preprocessing is  different to the 'official reference' version we use for the marking system.  \n",
    "   You might like to try developing your AIML in pandorabots then importing it into these jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Good places to look for help with AIML syntax are: \n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML-Fundaments](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-fundamentals)\n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML reference - for syntax](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-reference/)\n",
    " - [The official AIML site](http://www.aiml.foundation/doc.html)\n",
