    "We will look at the key differences between the two algorithms and also consider how network architecture and training parameters affects the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "1. Understand the key differences between the Neural Network and Perceptron algorithms:\n",
    "- Non-linear activation functions.\n",
    "- Using Backpropagation to update (learn) the weights.\n",
    "- configuring MLP with more than one output node when there are more than two different output labels (multi-class learning)\n",
    "2. Understand how different nodes learn different aspects of the problem.\n",
