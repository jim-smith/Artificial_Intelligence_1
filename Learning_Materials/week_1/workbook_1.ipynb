    "\n",
    "0. The first part of this workbook will aim to familiarise you with Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "    - The two types of cells **code** and **markdown**.\n",
    "    - Selecting a python environment and running code.\n",
    "    - The different colour information boxes we use in the workbooks, and what they mean.\n",
    "<br><br>    \n",
    "1. The first activity this week is to refresh your python coding skills by writing a simple algorithm that tries all the possible combinations of 4 digits to solve a combination lock puzzle.\n",
    "    - We provide a simple class for a puzzle with methods to set a problem and test whether an attempt has cracked the code.\n",
    "    - The task is to implement your algorithm in a method that can be tested using code from the problem class.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. The second activity asks you to examine your algorithm's performance as the *complexity* of the combination lock changes.\n",
    "    - For example, we could add more digits, or more values per digit.\n",
    "    - The task is to use experiments and reasoning to answer a number of interactive multiple-choice questions.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third activity introduces the `numpy` package which is incredibly useful for all sorts of numeric computing.  \n",
    "   There are some simple code cells to work through which illustrate how to:\n",
    "    - *Slice* datasets (arrays) to retrieve subsets of their data.\n",
    "    - Get statistics (e.g. mean/min/max and unique values) of numeric data.\n",
    "    - Task 3 is to write a method that combines array slicing with some simple string processing to extract a set of values from a character array.\n",
    "    - For those that feel confident, Task 4 is to combine code snippets from the previous cells to create a new method that could be used as part of a different problem; evaluating an attempt to solve a Sudoku problem."

    "\n",
    "### Making arrays full of zeros/ones etc\n",
    "- via functions like ```np.zeros((rows, columns), datatype)```\n",
    "- see [the numpy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.array-creation.html) for more details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics that describe contents: mean, max and min\n",
    "- if we call ```np.mean(my_1D_array)```,  ```np.max(my_1D_array)``` or ```np.min(my_1D_array)``` on a 1D array we get what you would expect\n",
    "- if we call the methods on a N-Dimensional array we get results for the whole array\n",
    "- but we can also get it for different dimensions by specifying what *axis* we want\n",
    "- and ```np.argmax(myarray)``` or ```np.argmin(myarray)``` tell us *where* the biggest/smallest values are in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions that manipulate arrays into different shapes\n",
    "- `np.reshape()` can be suprisingly handy, especially for getting data into the right format for a machine learning algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "**Work through the 5 cells below, reading then running them:**  \n",
    "make sure you understand what they are doing - you'll be using these functions a lot in the next few weeks. \n",
