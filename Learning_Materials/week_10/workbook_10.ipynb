    "\n",
    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will encode some knowledge about language using some of the AIML tags you learned about in last weeks workbook.\n",
    "    - We will be creating a chatbot that can act like customer support and respond to customer queries about missing orders.\n",
    "    - We will use the `<srai>` tag-pairs you learned about last week and also use `<random>` to produce random responses (from a selection) to help test the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook will introduce `<that>` tags to embed long-term knowledge and context within your chatbot.\n",
    "    - `<that>` tags allow your bot respond differently depending on the context of a dialogue.\n",
    "    - In other words, if the input is the same the bot can change its response depending on what has previously been said.\n",
    "    - **You will need this to pass the coursework**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third part of the workbook will introduce wildcards which are able to match to any string in an input `<pattern>` and make categories more general.\n",
    "    - The `*` and `_` characters can be used as wildcards to match one or more words in a users input `<pattern>` (`_` has a higher priority when matching).\n",
    "    - The `<star/>` tags are used to match to wildcards in the `<template>`. For example, a word matched in with a `*` in the `<pattern>` can be *referenced* in with the `<star/>` tag in the `<template>`.\n",
    "    - [This is a useful reference](https://medium.com/pandorabots-blog/wildcards-in-aiml-da7f4a29f42e).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The fourth part of the workbook will introduce the `<set>` and `<think>` tags which allow the bot to store variables.\n",
    "    - The `<set>` tag allows the bot to create a name;value pair (variable) to store information from the input `<pattern>`, i.e. matched with `<star/>`.\n",
    "    - The `<think>` tag allows the bot to create variables with `<set>` *silently*, i.e. without including it in the response the the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, we will bring all this together for the coursework.\n",
    "    - You should use all of these tags to create an AIML file (chatbot) that is able to respond to the 45 questions and answers in the `portfolio-questions-and-responses.txt` file.\n",
    "    - You get more marks by doing this in as few categories as possible.\n",
    "    - We provide a `AIML_Selfchecker.ipynb` file to run the marking programme and check your knowledge-base before submission.\n",

    "You should now have knowledge of all of the AIML concepts and tags that you need to complete the final part of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this weeks folder you will find a file called `portfolio-questions-and-responses-2025.txt` which contains 45 questions and corresponding answers. The task is to author a single file AIML  code that can be loaded into a bot and correctly answer all 45 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will score more marks for using the knowledge representation language features supported by AIML to reduce the redundancy in  your knowledge base by using as few categories as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided an `AIML_Selfchecker.ipyb` for you to develop and test your chatbot. You can use it to test your AIML using exactly the same code as on the marking server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the notebook `AIML_Selfchecker.ipyb` in this directory.\n",
    "    - The first cell is for you to develop you aiml code in.\n",
    "        - When you run that cell it writes your aiml to a file called `student.aiml`\n",
    "        - **Do not change the name of the file produced (i.e. leave it as student.aiml)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Subsequent cells in the notebook run a copy of the same code that is on the marking system.\n",
    "        - **Note that every time the marking system runs it asks the question in a different order**.\n",
    "        - But it does keep together the 3 questions that naturally follow on from a particular response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It should give you output on screen and also produce two files:\n",
    "        - \"student-feedback\" with a copy of what is shown on screen.\n",
    "        - \"student-responses.txt\" which shows you eaach question in turn, what was expected, and what your bot produced, nicely aligned so you can check for typos, missing punctuation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the ideas from week 9 and 10, edit the first cell (which produces \"student.aiml\") to contain categories encoding all the information you need to answer the set of 45 questions in `portfolio-questions-and-responses-2025.txt`.\n",
    "    - We suggest you might start with 45 categories and get your bot correctly answering all the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You will need to use some categories with `<that>` tag-pairs to answer three of the questions correctly, because they rely on the previous question to provide context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then use what you have learned about `<srai>` tags and wildcards to reduce the number of categories in your file - **this will get you more marks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For even more marks try including `<think>`, `<set>` and `<get>` tags and looking at the lecture notebook to see how `<condition>` tags work in AIML.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once you have completed your AIML you just need to submit the file `student.aiml` produced by the `AIML_Selfchecker.ipyb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure your \"student.aiml\" file is somewhere that is automatically backed up (like your UWE onedrive).**\n",
