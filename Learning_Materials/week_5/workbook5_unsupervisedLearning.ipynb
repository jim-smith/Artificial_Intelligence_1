    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 5 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This session is designed to give you experience of:\n",
    "- loading an unlabelled dataset in python\n",
    "- creating 'Data Visualisations' --such as 2D and 3D scatter plots with different colourings to examine the relationships between the values of different features\n",
    "     in your data set\n",
    "- running the unsupervised clustering algorithm 'k-Means' and examining the effect of different settings for parameters such as the number of clusters\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood how to go about visualising a new data set\n",
    "- Understood how to find clusters - if they exist - in your data.\n",
    "- Understood the importance of selecting and applying suitable  data preprocessing methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Completed the exercises below for the Iris dataset\n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your revision bot with definitions and examples for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "- **Seaborn** is a richer library you can import into notebooks for easily making visualisations. Try looking at the example gallery from here: https://seaborn.pydata.org\n",
    "         \n",
    "- There is lots of help available for producing plots in matplotlib - if in doubt, just google your error!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **plotly** is a fantastic toolkit for making really nice data visualisations where you can link different plots so they respond together as you zoom/pan/select different features to look at.\n",
    "  - You can install it locally and run within a notebook,  but this is probably too complex to go into in this module.\n",
    "  - but you can upload your data and create really nice visualisations here: https://chart-studio.plotly.com/create/#/\n",

    "For each individual feature j (column in X) it: \n",
    "- finds the highest  and lowest  values in column j of X\n",
    "- uses these to calculate  the *range* of values in the column range(X[,j]) = max(X[,j] - min(X[,j])  \n",
    "- subtracts the min(X[,j]) from each value so that they now all start from 0 and the highest value is now max(X[,j] - min(X[,j])\n",
    "- divide each value by the range(X[,j]) so the upper value  is now 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're feeling confident about numpy arrays and data slicing you could try implementing this your self using a loop over each column (X.shape[1]) and doing slicing making calls to numpy's min(), max() functions.  \n",
