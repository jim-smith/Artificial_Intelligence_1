    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 5 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This session is designed to give you experience of the numpy library in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is the foundation of practical machine learning and data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create simple 2-dimensional numpy arrays filled with zeros, ones or empty\n",
    "- do 'data slicing' to extract different 'views' from a numpy array\n",
    "- use functions like shape() to access the sizew of the array\n",
    "- use simple functions like min() max() and mean() to get statistics about the whole arrays, or particular rows and columns in it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Completed the exercises below for the Iris dataset\n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your revision bot with definitions and examples for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "There is lots of help available for working with numpy- if in doubt, just google your error!\n",
    "\n",
    "- this has lots of good illustrations and is a five minute read up to \"Data Representation\": http://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy/\n",
    "\n",
    "- this is a great quick start guide to numpy:\n",
    "  - https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- this is a longer walk through but very professional produced with exampels otrun and try : https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "- this ia a good read recommended by Nathan: \n",
