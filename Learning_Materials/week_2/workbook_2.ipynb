    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will implement the Depth-first and Breadth-first search algorithms.\n",
    "    - We will test the algorithms on the combination lock problem from last week.\n",
    "    - We provide an implementation of the pseudocode from the lectures.\n",
    "    - This will give you experience **implementing** and **testing** the algorithms within a common code framework that we provide.\n",
    "    - This will also help to build your python skills and confidence with using and adapting other people's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook give you hands-on experience of **extending**  algorithms to different contexts.\n",
    "    - In this case, adapting depth-first search to try and make it work for the fox-chicken-grain problem."

    "- You have a fox, a chicken and a sack of grain.  \n",
    "- You must cross a river with only one of them at a time.\n",
    "- If you leave the fox with the chicken he will eat it.\n",
    "- If you leave the chicken with the grain she will eat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you get all three across safely in less than ten moves?\n",

    "### Design Statement for fox-chicken-grain problem<img src = \"figures/fox-chicken-grain-partial-graph.png\" style = \"float:right\" width=25%>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 moves in total: {nothing, fox, chicken, grain} X {bank0to1, bank1to0}.   \n",
    "**Computers don't understand language** (despite the myths about chat-gpt), so we have to assign *labels* to *moves*.  \n",
    "For example, moving nothing from bank 0 to 1 might be `0`,  \n",
    "and moving the fox from bank 0 to bank 1 might be `1`, and so on.\n",
    "- so ```FoxChickenGrain.value_set``` = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the `CombinationProblem`, a candidate solution may have one or more moves, not a fixed number\n",
    "- so we encode ```FoxChickenGrain.numdecisions= -1``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, ```CandidateSolution.variable_values``` is a list of values in the range [0,...7] which **encodes** a sequence of moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "```FoxChickenGrain.evaluate(attempt:list)``` decodes the sequence of moves as follows.   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It starts from state(0,0,0,0), where everything is safely on the first bank, and takes the first move in the sequence.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that it loops:\n",
    "- applying the move to get the next state:\n",
    "- *if* move can't be applied *then* do nothing and leave state unchanged\n",
    "- *else if* next state in forbidden list *then* return INFEASIBLE (-1) (Something gets eaten!)\n",
    "- *else if* next state = (1,1,1,1)*then* return SUCCESS (1)\n",
    "- *else* get  next move in sequence and return to start of loop\n",
    "  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method returns:\n",
    "- -1 (infeasible),\n",
    "- 0 (ok but doesn't reach goal) or \n",
    "- 1 (reaches goal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Choices for generating each 1-step neighbour (`ApplyMoveOperator()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perturbative:** uses a *fixed* number of moves, like we did with the combination lock.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could use a nested loop through each position (1...n) and value (0...7) changing a specific move to the new value.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means each solution has *d* moves and 7d neighbours (7 different values in d different positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is:\n",
    "   1. ```FoxChickenGrain.evaluate(attempt)``` would need to stop as soon as it gets to the goal (and ignore the rest of the moves)\n",
    "   2. We would need to set a value for *d* which is not:\n",
    "    - too low to find a solution. \n",
    "    - too high, so we waste time changing the end of long sequences that are never reached\n",
    "   3. We would need to specify a valid starting point which has a sequence of valid neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is getting really far from the idea of reusable code that we can apply quickly to solve any problem.   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So *this is not* a good design choice if we want to get something implemented quickly!\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Constructive:** uses an *unspecified* number of moves.   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time we create 1-step neighbours which **add** moves to the existing solution.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. each solution with *d* moves has 8 neighbours, all with *d+1* moves.\n",
    "  - Avoids most of the problems with perturbative in this case\n",
    "  - But what about potential loops?"
